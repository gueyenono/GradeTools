## Purpose

This web app is designed to help students calculate their grade and other related stuff!

## Improvement ideas

- Have the users type the different evaluations' types themselves if they need to.

- Upgrade the "grade output" for it to look nicer

- Add "total weights" to the "grade output"

- Add a field for bonus points (maybe?)

- Add another tab to the app for students who need to know what they need to make on their next test to achieve a specific grade
