# Introduction

_(Practical example with actual scores and what not)_


# Notations

_Superscript *_ means desired value.

Let $X_i$ be an assessment type with $i \in \{1, 2, ...\}$. 

- $X_1$: homework
- $X_2$: quizzes
- $X_3$: tests

$n_i$ is the number of times $X_i$ was administered:

- $n_1 = 2$: 2 homework assignments
- $n_2 = 3$: 3 quizzes
- $n_3 = 2$: 2 tests

$X_{ij}$ is the $j^{th}$ score obtain in $X_i$ assessment category.

- $X_{11}$ is the first homework score and $X_{12}$ is the second homework score.
- The quizzes scores are $X_{21}$, $X_{22}$ and $X_{23}$.
- Finally, the test scores are $X_{31}$ and $X_{32}$.

Finally, $w_i$ is the weight of $X_i$:

- $w_1$ is the weight of $X_1$: homework
- $w_2$ is the weight of $X_2$: quizzes
- $w_3$ is the weigsht of $X_3$: tests


# Computing total grade

First step, compute the percent average $\bar{X_i}$ for each assessment type:

$$
\bar{X_i} = \frac{1}{n_i}\sum_{k = 1}^{n_i}X_{ik}
$$

_(Use data in intro to compute average for each assessment type)_

Then, the weight is applied to the corresponding assessment type.

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_i\bar{X_i}
$$

The total grade is obtained by adjusting the above sum for the total weights of assessment types, which have been administered so far. Let the total grade be $G$:

$$
G = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_i\bar{X_i}}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_i}
$$


# The computation of marginal grade improvement

_"What do I need to make on the next test to get a B?"_. Let's the desired grade be $G^*$. The required grade improvement is, therefore, $G^* - G$.

First, we need to compute the impact on total grade of an increase in any average $\bar{X_i}$:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial{G}}{\partial{\bar{X_i}}} &= \frac{w_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_i}\bar{X_i}^{-1} \\
\frac{\partial{G}}{\partial{\bar{X_i}}} &= \frac{w_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_i\bar{X_i}}
\end{align}
$$

The student's goal is to increase the average $\bar{X_i}$ such that the impact on $G$ is equal to $G^* - G$.

$$
\begin{align}
G^* - G &= \frac{\partial{G}}{\partial{\bar{X_i}}} \\
       &= \frac{w_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_i}\bar{X_i}^{-1} \\
       &= \frac{w_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_i\bar{X_i}}
\end{align}
$$

The new average the student needs to reach after the next assessment is:

$$
\bar{X_i}^* = \frac{w_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_i(G^* - G)}
$$

Now, we can compute the exact score needed by the student. Currently, the number of assessments within the category of interest is $n_i$ and the average is $\bar{X_i}$. Once again, the average is:

$$
\bar{X_i} = \frac{1}{n_i}\sum_{k = 1}^{n_i}X_{ik}
$$
 
However, the desired average is computed as:

$$
\bar{X_i}^* = \frac{1}{n_i + 1}\sum_{k = 1}^{n_i + 1}X_{ik} \\
$$

which can be rewritten as:

$$
\bar{X_i}^* = \frac{1}{n_i + 1}\sum_{k = 1}^{n_i }X_{ik} + \frac{X_{i(n_i+1)}}{n_i + 1}
$$

$X_{i(n_i+1)}$ is essentially what the student is trying to find. It is the score of the next assessment that the student needs to obtain in order to achieve $\bar{X_i}^*$ and ultimately get their desired grade.

The final step is the determination of $X_{i(n_i+1)}$. This can be achieved by equation the two main expressions for $\bar{X_i}^*$ above:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{n_i + 1}\sum_{k = 1}^{n_i }X_{ik} + \frac{X_{i(n_i+1)}}{n_i + 1} &= \frac{w_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_i(G^* - G)} \\
                                               \frac{X_{i(n_i+1)}}{n_i + 1} &= \frac{w_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_i(G^* - G)} - \frac{1}{n_i + 1}\sum_{k = 1}^{n_i }X_{ik}
\end{align}
$$

The final result is:

$$
X^*_{i(n_i+1)} = \frac{(n_i + 1)w_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_i(G^* - G)} - \sum_{k = 1}^{n_i }X_{ik}
$$
